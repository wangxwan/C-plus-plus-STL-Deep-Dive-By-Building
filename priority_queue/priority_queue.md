# `priority_queue`

[Problem Description](Problem.md)

[Solution](Implementation.cpp)


`priority_queue` is implemented using a heap data structure.

The C++ standard library uses `std::make_heap`, `std::push_heap`, and `std::pop_heap` to implement `priority_queue`.  

[This code demonstrates a custom implementation.](usage.cpp)

## How Heaps Work

A heap is a specialized complete binary tree that satisfies the following properties:
