# Differences from the Standard Library

The C++ STL's `multiset` implementation is significantly more complex, incorporating numerous optimizations and engineering details.  Here are some key differences between this simplified code and the STL implementation:

- **Performance Optimizations:** The STL implementation includes performance optimizations for various scenarios, such as iterator implementation, memory allocation strategies, and node storage methods.  The STL is highly tuned for performance across a wide range of use cases.
- **Exception Safety:** STL containers typically provide strong exception safety, meaning that the container's state will not be corrupted in the event of an exception. This involves exception handling for node insertion, deletion, etc.
- **Allocator Support:** STL containers allow users to provide custom allocators to adapt to different memory management needs. This simplified code doesn't consider allocator support.
- **Iterator Complexity:** STL iterators typically support various types of iteration, including forward iteration, reverse iteration, constant iteration, etc. This simplified code only provides a basic inorder traversal.
- **Comparator Support:** STL allows users to provide custom comparators to support different element comparison methods. This simplified code uses the default comparator.
- **Branch Prediction and Inlining:** STL implementations often leverage branch prediction, inlining, and other compiler optimization techniques to improve code execution efficiency.
- **Container State Management:** STL containers typically include a range of member functions and state information for managing the container's state, such as `size()`, `empty()`, etc.
- **Iterator Invalidation Handling:** STL containers handle iterator invalidation issues during element insertion and deletion to ensure iterator correctness. This simplified code does not provide this handling.
- **These differences highlight the potential discrepancies between this simplified code and a real-world STL implementation.** The STL implementation is rigorously tested and optimized to ensure high performance and stability across various usage scenarios.
