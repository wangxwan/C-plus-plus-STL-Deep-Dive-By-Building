# `unordered_set`

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a crucial part of C++, providing a range of generic data structures and algorithms.

Within the STL, `std::unordered_set` is an unordered associative container implemented using a hash table. This document delves into the inner workings of `std::unordered_set`, covering aspects such as hash tables, collision resolution, iterators, and performance optimization.
