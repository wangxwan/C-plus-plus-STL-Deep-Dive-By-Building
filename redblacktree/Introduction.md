# Introduction

A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that adds an extra attribute to each node indicating its color, which can be either red or black.  Red-black trees maintain the following properties to ensure balance:

- **Node Color:** Each node is either red or black.
- **Root Color:** The root node is black.
- **Leaf Node (NIL Node) Color:** All leaf nodes (NIL nodes) are black.
- **Adjacent Node Color:** If a node is red, both its children are black.
- **Black Height:** All paths from any node to its descendant leaf nodes contain the same number of black nodes.

These properties ensure key characteristics of red-black trees, such as O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations in the worst case.

## Node Structure

Each element in a red-black tree maps to a node. Each node typically includes the following information:

- **Key:** The actual data value, used for comparison and sorting.
- **Color:**  Indicates the node's color (red or black), crucial for balancing the tree.
- **Left and Right Child Pointers:** Pointers to the left and right child nodes.
- **Parent Pointer:** A pointer to the parent node.

## Insertion Operation

When inserting an element into a red-black tree, the following steps are performed:

- **Locate Insertion Point:** Starting from the root node, find the appropriate insertion point using binary search tree rules.
- **Insert New Node:** Create a new node at the insertion point and set its color to red.
- **Repair Red-Black Tree Properties:** If the parent of the new node is red, a series of rotations and recoloring operations are needed to maintain the red-black tree's balance.

These steps ensure efficient and balanced insertion.

## Deletion Operation

Deletion is relatively more complex but still adheres to the balancing principles. When deleting a node, several operations might be necessary:

- **Mark Node:** Mark the node to be deleted as "deleted" instead of immediately removing it.
- **Delete Node:** Delete the node based on the situation and replace it with a child node.
- **Repair Red-Black Tree Properties:** If the deleted node or its replacement is red, or if the deleted node was the root, a series of rotations and recoloring operations might be needed to maintain balance.

These steps ensure efficient deletion with logarithmic time complexity.
