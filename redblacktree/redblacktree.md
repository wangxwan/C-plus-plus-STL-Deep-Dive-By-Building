# Red-Black Tree

[Problem Description](Problem.md)

[Solution](Implementation.cpp)


The underlying data structure for `set` and `map` is a red-black tree. Therefore, it's necessary to understand the principles and implementation of red-black trees.

## Introduction

A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that adds an extra attribute to each node indicating its color, which can be either red or black.  Red-black trees maintain the following properties to ensure balance:

## Differences from the Standard Library

This simplified red-black tree implementation differs significantly from the red-black tree in the C++ STL standard library, primarily in the following aspects:

1. **Performance and Optimization:** The C++ STL implementation is rigorously performance-optimized and tuned, considering various boundary conditions and edge cases to provide high efficiency. The simplified version lacks such optimizations.

2. **Exception Handling:** The C++ STL implementation typically includes exception handling for situations such as memory allocation failures. The simplified version does not address this.

3. **Template Specialization and Configuration:** C++ STL containers are configurable and specializable, allowing users to provide custom comparators, allocators, etc. The simplified version does not consider these configuration options.

4. **Iterators and Algorithms:** C++ STL containers usually come with iterators, facilitating the use of STL algorithms. The simplified version does not implement these features.

5. **Memory Management:** The C++ STL implementation typically employs efficient memory management techniques, while the simplified version may not consider such optimizations.


## Frequently Asked Interview Questions

1. **What are the properties of a red-black tree?**

   Answer: A red-black tree has five important properties:

   - Each node is either red or black.
   - The root node is black.
   - Every leaf node (NIL node, null node) is black.
   - If a node is red, then both its children are black (no two consecutive red nodes on any path from a leaf to the root).
   - All simple paths from any node to its descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

2. **Why are red-black tree operations logarithmic time complexity?**

   Answer: Red-black trees are self-balancing binary search trees that guarantee, in the worst case, a time complexity of O(log n) for basic operations (such as insertion, search, and deletion), where n is the number of elements in the tree. This is because the height of the tree is always kept at a logarithmic level, and all operations are performed along paths from the root to the leaves.

3. **How to verify if a binary tree is a red-black tree?**

   Answer: To verify if a binary tree is a red-black tree, we need to check if all five properties mentioned above are satisfied. This usually requires traversing the tree's nodes to check node colors and whether the number of black nodes is consistent across all paths.

4. **Why is a red-black tree not a perfectly balanced binary tree?**

   Answer: A perfectly balanced binary tree (such as an AVL tree) requires that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of each node is at most one. This high degree of balance guarantees optimal efficiency for tree operations, but maintaining this strict balance is costly because each insertion or deletion operation may require multiple rotations to ensure the tree's balance. In contrast, red-black trees allow for greater imbalance; they are only approximately balanced, which reduces the cost of maintaining balance, allowing insertion and deletion operations to be completed with fewer rotations. This trade-off is often advantageous in practical applications because it provides a good balance between performance and implementation complexity.
