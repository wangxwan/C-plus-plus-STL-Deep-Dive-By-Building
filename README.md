# C++ STL Deep Dive By Building

This repository houses a hands-on project for delving deep into the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) by building a simplified version of it yourself.

## Motivation

This project aims to foster a thorough understanding of the C++ STL not through rote memorization, but through the enlightening process of implementation. By building your own versions of core STL components, you'll gain practical insights into their inner workings, design choices, and performance implications.

## Contents

This repository contains both detailed learning notes and the implementation process for various STL components, categorized as follows:

- **Dynamic Arrays:** [vector](./vector/vecor.md)
- **Doubly Linked Lists:** [list](./list/list.md)
- **Double-Ended Queues:** [deque](./deque/deque.md)
- **Hash Tables:** [hashtable](./hashtable/hashtable.md)
- **Red-Black Trees:** [redblacktree](./redblacktree/redblacktree.md)
- **Ordered Sets:** [set](./set/set.md)
- **Unordered Sets:** [unordered_set](./unordered_set/unordered_set.md)
- **Ordered Multisets:** [multiset](./multiset/multiset.md)
- **Ordered Maps:** [map](./map/map.md)
- **Unordered Maps:** [unordered_map](./unordered_map/unordered_map.md)
- **Ordered Multimaps:** [multimap](./multimap/multimap.md)
- **Stacks:** [stack](./stack/stack.md)
- **Queues:** [queue](./queue/queue.md)
- **Priority Queues:** [priority_queue](./priority_queue)

## Key Features

* **Practice-Oriented:** Dive headfirst into coding by writing the STL components yourself.
* **From Zero to One:**  Start your STL mastery journey without prior knowledgeâ€”all you need is a grasp of C++ syntax. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate through the different component folders to access the code and accompanying learning notes.
3. Follow along with the provided code examples and explanations to build your own STL from scratch!

## Contributions

Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, or suggest new STL components to implement.  Contributions are always welcome! 

Happy coding!
