# Memory Management

`std::vector` maintains two important pieces of state information: capacity and size. Capacity represents the currently allocated memory space of the vector, while size represents the number of elements currently contained in the vector. When elements are added to the vector, if the number of elements exceeds the capacity, memory reallocation is required.

## Memory allocation and deallocation are important internal operations of `std::vector`.

When the capacity is insufficient to accommodate new elements, `std::vector` allocates a new block of memory, copies the existing elements to the new memory, and then releases the original memory. This process ensures contiguous storage of elements.

## Dynamic Resizing Strategy:

To improve performance, `std::vector` employs a strategy called "exponential growth" for dynamic resizing. 

When resizing is needed, `std::vector` typically doubles its capacity to avoid frequent memory allocation operations, thereby reducing system overhead. 

This exponential growth strategy ensures that insertion operations have constant time complexity on average, rather than linear time complexity.

## Random Access and Iterators:

`std::vector` provides efficient random access, meaning direct access to elements via their index. 

This is because the elements are stored contiguously in memory, and access can be achieved with O(1) time complexity through simple pointer arithmetic.

## Performance Considerations:

`std::vector` performs well in many scenarios, but it's important to note that in cases of frequent insertions or deletions, `std::vector` may not be the optimal choice, as such operations can trigger frequent dynamic resizing, leading to performance degradation. 

In such cases, consider using containers like `std::deque` or `std::list` (which will be discussed later), which offer better performance for insertion and deletion operations.
