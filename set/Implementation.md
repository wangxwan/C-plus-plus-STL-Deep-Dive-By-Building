# Code Implementation

Based on a previously implemented Red-Black Tree class (assuming its definition and implementation are in `RedBlackTree.h`), a simplified `Set` implementation would look like this:

[This code example uses a previously implemented Red-Black Tree.](Implementation.cpp)

This simplified implementation stores each `set` element as the `key` in the Red-Black Tree, without further encapsulation.  Function descriptions can be found in the Red-Black Tree section.
